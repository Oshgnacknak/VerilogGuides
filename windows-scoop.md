# Installing SystemVerilog on Windows using scoop

In this guide we'll show you, how to install all necessary tools for synthesizing or simulating your SystemVerilog projects.

If you don't want to install scoop, check out our [manual guide](windows-manual.md).

## Installing scoop

[scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a simple package manager for Windows.

You can install scoop using PowerShell.

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

## Installing SystemVerilog

Now you can install the required packages for SystemVerilog.

```ps1
scoop install graphviz sed iverilog
```

*sccop adds all installed packages automatically to the PATH.*

Sadly there's no package for *yosys*. 
You have to download the file [`yosys-win32-mxebin-0.9.zip`](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/nogit/win32/yosys-win32-mxebin-0.9.zip), 
extract it somewhere and the new folder to your PATH.

After everything is installed, run `dot -c` once to configure all plugins for graphviz. 

*This step may be optional in the future when a version including the pull request 
[1581](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/merge_requests/1581) has been released.*

## Testing your installation

Download and extract the .zip file from our Moodle course.

Then open the folder `SystemVerilog\src\comb` in PowerShell and run the following commands:
```ps1
# Testing the synthesis
..\..\bin\synth.bat example example.sv
# Testing the simulation
..\..\bin\sim.bat example_tb example.sv example_tb.sv
```

Now there should be a new file in the same folder called `example.pdf` which is the result of the synthesis, 
and an application called GTKWave should open up, which displays measurements of the simulation.

## Updates
This step is *optional*.

If you want to keep your packages installed via scoop up-to-date, 
you have to download the package git, so you have to run once:

```ps1
scoop install git
```

Now you can update all of your packages at once (except `yosys`):
```ps1
scoop update *
```

I recommend that you run this command occasionally (maybe once a month). 

*Further information*

You can find a lot of useful tools in the scoop repository, just search for it.
```
scoop search <package>
```

## Visual Studio Code
This step is *optional*.

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor from Microsoft with lots of extensions.

You can download the software [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and once you installed it,
there's an extension for SystemVerilog called 
[`Verilog-HDL/SystemVerilog/Bluespec SystemVerilog`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mshr-h.VerilogHDL). 
Open the sidebar, search for it and install it.

Now you can easily edit highlighted `.sv` files.
